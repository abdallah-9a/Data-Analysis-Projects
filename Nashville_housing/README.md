## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps

To ensure data accuracy and consistency, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

### 🔹 1. Standardizing Column Names

Renamed columns for better readability and uniformity.

### 🔹 2. Splitting Address Fields

Separated compound address fields into distinct components for better data organization.

### 🔹 3. Standardizing Categorical Data

Ensured consistency in categorical columns by converting values into a uniform format.

### 🔹 4. Removing Duplicates

Identified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

### 🔹 5. Handling Missing Values

Replaced empty values with `NULL` and removed records with excessive missing data.

### 🔹 6. Correcting Data Types

Converted columns to appropriate data types for accurate analysis and calculations.

### 🔹 7. Formatting Numerical Data

Standardized numerical fields by removing unwanted characters and ensuring proper formatting.
