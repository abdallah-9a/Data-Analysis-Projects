# Mall Customers Data Cleaning and Visualization Project

## 📄 Project Description

This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing customer data from a mall dataset. It aims to preprocess messy data, handle outliers, and provide meaningful visualizations for better business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** Core language for data analysis
- **pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy:** Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib:** Static visualizations
- **Seaborn:** Advanced data visualization

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Data Import:** Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure.
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Detect and handle missing data.
  - Remove outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- **Data Visualization:** Analyze customer spending patterns and visualize relationships between key features.

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Distribution plots for customer segments
- Box plots to detect and visualize outliers
- Heatmaps for feature correlations
