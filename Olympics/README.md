# **Olympics Data Analysis** 🏅

## **Project Overview**

This project explores the history of the Olympic Games using a dataset that documents past events, athletes, and medalists. The dataset provides valuable insights into the evolution of the Olympics, the nations that participated, and the most successful athletes and countries.

The analysis is divided into two main parts:

1. **Data Cleaning** – Preparing the dataset by handling inconsistencies and missing values.
2. **Data Analysis & Insights** – Answering key questions to extract meaningful insights.

## **Data Cleaning Steps** 🛠️

Before analyzing the dataset, the following cleaning steps were applied:  
✅ **Removed leading and trailing white spaces** from categorical columns.  
✅ **Standardized the "Sex" column** by replacing `"M"` with `"Male"` and `"F"` with `"Female"`.  
✅ **Converted missing values (`NA`) to `NULL`** to ensure proper SQL handling.
